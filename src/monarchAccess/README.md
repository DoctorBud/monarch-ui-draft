## MonarchAccess Client-side API bindings

- Don't put UI code in this module
- Currently assumes a browser environment, but may eventually support NodeJS usage.
- Currently all code is in index.js, but this may eventually be broken into multiple files that are included by index.js before being exported as the MonarchAccess module.
